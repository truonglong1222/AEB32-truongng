      London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in
      Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the
      streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth,
      and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or
      so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill.
